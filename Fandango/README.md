# 🎬 College Data Manipulation Assignment — Fandango & Movie Ratings

This repository contains my submission for the **College Data Manipulation & Python Assignment**, focusing on analyzing movie ratings across multiple platforms using **Pandas**.
The assignment uses real datasets inspired by the Fandango movie ratings study.

## 📁 **Datasets Used**

The following CSV files are provided for analysis:

* `fandango.csv`
* `imdb.csv`
* `metacritic.csv`
* `rt.csv`

Each dataset contains movie ratings from different platforms, allowing for merging, comparison, and analysis.
