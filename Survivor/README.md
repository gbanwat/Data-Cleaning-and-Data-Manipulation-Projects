# 🏝️ Survivor Data Manipulation & Analysis (Pandas Project)

This repository contains my complete analysis for a college assignment using the **Survivor TV show dataset**.
The goal of this project is to apply full-stack **data cleaning**, **wrangling**, and **manipulation** skills in Pandas to answer detailed analytical questions about contestants, seasons, personalities, voting history, and challenge outcomes.

## 📄 **Overview**

This assignment uses a comprehensive Survivor dataset originally created in R by **Daniel Oehm** and adapted for this course. Using Pandas, the project involves:

✔ Loading multiple spreadsheets from a single Excel file
✔ Standardizing column names
✔ Merging and joining datasets
✔ Grouping and aggregating
✔ Working with personalities, voting patterns, and show mechanics
✔ Creating derived variables (dummy variables, MBTI breakdown, age categories)
✔ Solving multi-step analytical questions

The dataset includes details about castaways, tribes, challenges, idols, confessionals, tribes, jury votes, vote history, and more.
