This repository contains my solution to a college assignment focused on NumPy array manipulation, image reconstruction, and matplotlib visualization.

The task involves reversing a set of NumPy transformations to recover an original image from a transformed RGB array.

📄 Assignment Summary

For this assignment:

A picture containing a specific phrase was converted into a NumPy RGB array.

That array was then transformed using several NumPy operations.

My task was to reverse those transformations and reconstruct the original image.

The final output must be displayed using matplotlib and submitted as a Jupyter Notebook to CodeGrade.

📁 Dataset

The dataset provided:

array.txt — contains the transformed NumPy array representing the image.

🧰 Libraries Used

NumPy — for array manipulation

Matplotlib — for visualizing the reconstructed image

🎯 Objectives

This project demonstrates:

✔ Loading numerical data from a text file
✔ Understanding and reversing NumPy transformations
✔ Reshaping arrays into valid image dimensions
✔ Visualizing RGB images using matplotlib.pyplot.imshow()
✔ Working with array indexing, slicing, reshaping, and type conversions

📓 Notebook

All work is contained in:

👉 Picture Phrase.ipynb

The notebook includes:

Loading the transformed array

Sequentially reversing each transformation

Reshaping back into an image-friendly shape

Displaying the final recovered image

Explanation and documentation of each step
