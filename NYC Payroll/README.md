# 📊 NYC Payroll Data Analysis — Data Cleaning & Manipulation Assignment

This project demonstrates data cleaning, data manipulation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using **NumPy** and **Pandas** on the **NYC Payroll Data** from NYC Open Data.
The analysis was completed as part of an academic assignment that focuses on transforming, cleaning, and analyzing real-world payroll information using Python.

## 📝 Overview

In this assignment, the objective was to use payroll data downloaded from NYC Open Data to answer instructor-provided analytical questions. The tasks included:

* Cleaning raw data
* Performing data manipulation and aggregation
* Applying `groupby`, filtering, sorting, multi-level indexing, and pivot tables
* Extracting insights from the payroll dataset

After completing the analysis, the answers are used to complete a quiz on Brightspace (the code is not uploaded to CodeGrade).

The project also serves as practice in building real-world data processing workflows.

## 📥 Dataset

The raw dataset is too large to be uploaded directly to GitHub.
It can be downloaded from Google Drive using the link below:
